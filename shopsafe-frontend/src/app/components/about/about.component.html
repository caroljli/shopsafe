                <p>
                    ShopSafe is a tool designed to help ease the decision fatigue that comes with 
                    deciding what is the safest place to go shopping during COVID-19. The purpose 
                    of this tool is to provide a crowdsourced method of evaluating the safety of 
                    a grocery store to give users a more informed shopping experience.

                <p>
                    This tool is meant to be used in concurrence with good judgement and awareness 
                    of local regulations. The ShopSafe Score is calculated using the check-in and 
                    county statistics based on user input and the New York Times COVID-19 dataset. 
                    This is not a deterministic metric but rather a decision-making tool.
